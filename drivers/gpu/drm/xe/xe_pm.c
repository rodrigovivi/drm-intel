 * Xe PM shall be guided by the simplicity.
 * Use the simplest hook options whenever possible.
 * Let's not reinvent the runtime_pm references and hooks.
 * Shall have a clear separation of display and gt underneath this component.
 *
 * What's next:
 *
 * For now s2idle and s3 are only working in integrated devices. The next step
 * is to iterate through all VRAM's BO backing them up into the system memory
 * before allowing the system suspend.
 *
 * Also runtime_pm needs to be here from the beginning.
 *
 * RC6/RPS are also critical PM features. Let's start with GuCRC and GuC SLPC
 * and no wait boost. Frequency optimizations should come on a next stage.
