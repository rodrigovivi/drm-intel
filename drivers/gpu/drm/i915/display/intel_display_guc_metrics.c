/**
 * Display GuC Metrics
 *
 * GuC SLPC has many optimized strategies to best select the running GT
 * frequency.
 * One common strategy is to take display metrics as input through a shared
 * data buffer. The GuC SLPC will then use these metrics for a optimal balance
 * between power savings and performance.
 *
 * This intel_display_guc_metrics, provides a generic interface where xe_guc_pc
 * or i915's intel_guc_slpc could register themselves in order to recieve the
 * metrics from the running intel_display.
 *
 * Since this is a generic interface, it won't take any further action, but only
 * pass the generic display information about refresh_info, flips and vblank.
 * The GuC SLPC component of the registered driver (Xe or i915) will then be
 * responsible for allocating the shared display buffer, for collecting the
 * right timestamp registers of the GT, and for programming the shared buffer
 * as requested by GuC.
 *
 * The Display Shared Data is a block of global GTT memory into which the host
 * continually writes display related information for SLPC to read and use in
 * its algorithms.
 *
 * The programming flow is as follows.
 *
 * The host allocates sufficient memory in the global GTT for the Display
 * Shared Data.
 *
 * The host initializes the Display Shared Data by setting the Version,
 * Number of Pipes, and Number of Planes per Pipe fields in the Global Info.
 * All other fields should start at 0.
 *
 * The host provides the Display Shared Data memory address in the Shared Data
 * while (re-)activating SLPC through the GUC_ACTION_HOST2GUC_PCV2_SLPC_REQUEST
 * Reset event. SLPC will now begin reading the Display Shared Data as part of
 * its periodic processing. It reads the Global Info section and proceeds to the
 * other sections only if a change count has been incremented.
 *
 * On a display connection to a pipe, the host writes the Refresh Info for the
 * given pipe, then increments the Refresh Info Change Count field of the Global
 * Info to alert SLPC to the change. This is also done if an existing display
 * changes its refresh configuration.
 *
 * On a vblank event, the host updates the Vblank Metrics for the given pipe,
 * then increments the Vblank Metrics Change Count field of the Global Info to
 * alert SLPC to the change.
 *
 * On a flip event, the host updates the Flip Metrics for the given plane on the
 * given pipe, then increments the Flip Metrics Change Count field of the Global
 * Info to alert SLPC to the change.
